## Overview

These guidelines are based in part on @tufte1983, with selected examples from Prof. James Hughes' BIOST 511 course offered in Autumn 2017; other good discussion can be found in @wainer1984, @proschan2016, and on [Karl Broman's webpage](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs/), among other places.

In general, graphs are good for showing `r colFmt("qualitative trends", "blue")`, with `r colFmt("large amounts of data", "red")`; tables are good for showing `r colFmt("exact values", "green")`, with `r colFmt("small amounts of data", "red")`. Today, we'll go through some guidelines for graphical integrity, and for displaying data in tables. We'll also learn how to create graphs and compute descriptive statistics in R.

We use both graphs and tables to `r colFmt("describe the data", "blue")`, and `r colFmt("provide visual evidence supporting statistical results", "green")`: both of these are crucial components of any data analysis, and adhering to good practices helps your reader to understand your analysis and results.

## Guidelines for graphical integrity

### Representing numbers graphically

The representation of numbers, `r colFmt("as physically measured", "blue")` on the surface of the graphic, should be `r colFmt("directly proportional", "green")` to the numerical quantities represented.

Consider the following graphic, from the Los Angeles Times (August 5, 1979):

```{r proportional_1, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", out.height="3in"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/proportional_1.png")
```

What's wrong with this graph? 

### Reference points

Provide `r colFmt("an appropriate reference point", "blue")`, `r colFmt("spacing", "green")`, and `r colFmt("labeling", "red")` for axes.

### Context

`r colFmt("Do not quote data out of context!", "red")`

### Focus on the data

Focus on the data, `r colFmt("not the design", "red")`, and maximize the data:ink ratio. 

### Labels

Use `r colFmt("clear, detailed, and thorough labeling", "blue")` to `r colFmt("defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity", "red")`. `r colFmt("Write out explanations", "green")` of the data on the graphic itself. `r colFmt("Label important events", "cyan")` in the data.
