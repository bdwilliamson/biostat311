# Instructions

Being able to present your work is an important skill. Here, you will give a group presentation of your data, scientific questions, statistical results, and scientific conclusions to the rest of the class. 

These presentations are limited to **8 slides (not including a title slide), totaling 10 minutes, including questions**. Ideally, you will talk for fewer than 10 minutes, so that your classmates have time to ask questions; regardless, **we will cut everything off at 10 minutes to ensure that each group has time to present**. Each section in the template below will be shorter than its corresponding section in the report---remember, you have a finite amount of time for the presentation! The main idea is to give your fellow classmates (and instructors) an idea of what you've been working on all quarter.

Submit your presentation slides on Canvas by 10:00am on May 29. **Do not discuss your project with students outside of your group or post questions about your project on the Canvas discussion board.** But, feel free to ask us any questions in person/over email instead!

This assignment is graded and is worth 20% of your total project grade.

## Scientific Questions (3 points)

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should include...

- your overall scientific goal
- one specific objective

in approximately 1 slide (you may also briefly mention any other goals of your analysis, but this is not necessary).

## What did you do? (3 points)

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should take your specific scientific question and tell us...

- what numerical or graphical descriptive analyses did you run 
- what type of regression analysis did you use, along with:
    - why you chose it,
    - what your outcome is,
    - and why you included the variables that you included
    
in approximately 1 slide.

## Results (4 points)

### Descriptive analyses (2 points)

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should show us the plot or numerical summaries that you mentioned in the previous section, and interpret them (approximately 1 slide); what does this summary tell us about your answer to your scientific question?

### Inferential analyses (2 points)

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should provide a full results summary for your chosen scientific question (approximately 1 slide).

## Discussion (3 points)

*Discuss what the statistical results you presented in the previous section mean in terms of the scientific questions that you posed at the beginning of the report.*

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should include...

- a summary of what you found
- a discussion of anything you found challenging, or unique features of your data that you had to deal with (and how you dealt with these features)
