# Instructions

A report detailing your conclusions is an integral part of any statistical analysis. You must be able to describe your conclusions, along with the methods that you used to address your questions, to your collaborators.

This assignment is limited to **ten pages (not including tables and figures)**, and your written text should use at least 12-point font. See the template below for a list of components that need to be included.

Submit your *First Draft* on Canvas by 11:59pm on May 18, and your *Final Report* by 11:59 on June 1. **Do not discuss your project with students outside of your group or post questions about your project on the Canvas discussion board.** But, feel free to ask us any questions in person/over email instead!
 
This assignment is graded. The *First Draft* is worth 10% of your project grade, is graded on effort/completion, and is not binding: you are welcome (and encouraged!) to incorporate any of our feedback into your final report. The *Final Report* is worth 50% of your project grade.

# Template:

## Title

Make up a title for your proposed study!

## Background and Introduction

Provide a brief description of your data to give perspective into the importance of the problem and the situation under study. In particular, why were the data collected? This section is particularly useful when the document is circulated beyond your immediate study team (so make sure that there's enough detail here that someone outside your group could read this section and understand the big picture).

## Scientific Questions

In this section, you should lay out the scientific agenda of your analysis. In particular, you should state both the overall scientific goal and the specific scientific objectives.

Example: a study of smoking and lung function in children

The overall scientific goal is to assess the association between smoking and lung function in children. Specifically, we will address the following questions:

1. Is smoking associated with decreased lung function in children?
2. If there is an association between smoking and decreased lung function, is this effect different in older versus younger children.

## Statistical Hypotheses

Connect the scientific questions listed above with statistical hypotheses, that you can test using your statistical tools. Make sure to list both the variables that you will use in each analysis, and how you plan to make your statistical inference (e.g., confidence intervals and p-values).

## Methods

### Study Design

How were the data collected? How many subjects are in the study? Include all necessary information for interpreting your analysis.

### Statistical Methods

Describe all of the descriptive statistics you will compute, how you will compute them, and how you will display your results. Generally, these are used informally to evaluate and compare subgroups, identify errors in the data, and identify patterns of missing data.

All statistical analyses should start with data description. Often, these descriptive analyses will support the inferential analyses you report. Figures and tables are both reasonable ways to display descriptive analyses.

Describe all of the inferential analyses you will run (e.g., linear regression), along with the estimates that you will report. These are the hypothesis tests and estimates that will be used to address each of the questions you listed in the "scientific questions" section. You should state the statistical method that will be used to test each hypothesis, along with the response variable for each question and the significance level you are using. List the assumptions required for the analysis.

Also, describe any variables that you adjust for as potential confounders, effect modifiers, or precision variables for each analysis. 

## Results

### Description of the study cohort

Actually run the descriptive analyses that you propose above, and report the results in tables or figures, as appropriate. 

### Inferential analyses

Report and interpret the effect estimates, confidence intervals, and p-values corresponding to each scientific question that you address. Write each formally.

## Discussion

Discuss what the statistical results you presented in the previous section mean in terms of the scientific questions that you posed at the beginning of the report.
