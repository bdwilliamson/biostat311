## Instructions

Statistical analysis plans (SAPs) are an integral part of any statistical analysis. In this document, you outline all of the statistical analyses you plan to run and any output that you plan to create. 

These are especially important for reproducibility of your results---anyone should be able to exactly re-create your analysis by reading your SAP.

This assignment is limited to **three pages (not including dummy tables and figures)**, and your written text should use at least 12-point font.

This assignment is graded. **Do not discuss with students outside of your group (within-group discussion is encouraged!) and do not use the Canvas discussion board for questions about this project**.

## Template:

### Title

Make up a title for your proposed study!

### Background and Introduction

Provide a brief description of your data to give perspective into the importance of the problem and the situation under study. In particular, why were the data collected? This section is particularly useful when the document is circulated beyond your immediate study team.

### Scientific questions

This section lays out the scientific agenda of your analysis. You should state both the overall scientific goal and the specific scientific objectives.

Example: a study of smoking and lung function in children

The overall scientific goal is to assess the association between smoking and lung function in children. Specifically, we will address the following questions:

1. Is smoking associated with decreased lung function in children?
2. If there is an association between smoking and decreased lung function, is this effect different in older versus younger children?

### Study Design

How were the data collected? How many subjects are in the study? Include all necessary information for interpreting your analysis.

### Statistical hypotheses

Connect the scientific questions listed above with statistical hypotheses, that you can test using your statistical tools. Make sure to list both the variables that you will use in each analysis, and how you plan to make your statistical inference (e.g., confidence intervals and p-values).

### Variables

List and briefly describe all variables that you will consider in any part of the analysis. For each variable, provide: a name, a brief description, classification according to type (quantitative for continuous or discrete variables; qualitative for nominal or ordinal variables), and a unit of measurement. Additionally, define new variables that are created from other measurements in the data, or variables that have been re-coded (e.g., creating a binary "female" variable from a "sex" variable taking on values 1 for male and 2 for female). Finally, classify each variable according to its scientific meaning and use in the analysis.

Examples of scientific meaning

* demographic (e.g., age, sex)
* baseline physiology (e.g., systolic blood pressure)
* baseline disease risk factors
* measures of treatment intervention (in an experiment) or exposure (in an observational study)
* measures of treatment outcome (in an experiment) or exposure effect (in an observational study)

Examples of use in an analysis (variables may have multiple uses, if they are used in multiple analyses!):

* response (outcome)
* predictors of interest, identifying treatment groups (experiment) or exposure (observational study)
* variables identifying subgroups to explore effect modification
* potential confounders
* variables which may increase precision
* surrogates for the response or intermediate outcomes

### Statistical analysis:

#### Descriptive analyses

Describe all of the descriptive statistics you will compute, how you will compute them, and how you will display your results. Generally, these are used informally to evaluate and compare subgroups, identify errors in the data, and identify patterns of missing data.

All statistical analyses should start with data description. Often, these descriptive analyses will support the inferential analyses you report. Figures and tables are both reasonable ways to display descriptive analyses.

#### Inferential analyses

Describe all of the inferential analyses you will run (e.g., linear regression), along with the estimates that you will report. These are the hypothesis tests and estimates that will be used to address each of the questions you listed in the "scientific questions" section. You should state the statistical method that will be used to test each hypothesis, along with the response variable for each question and the significance level you are using. List the assumptions required for the analysis.

### Dummy tables and figures

Include a sample of the tables and figures you expect to see here, so that you can make sure you know what you want!
