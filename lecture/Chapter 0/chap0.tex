\begin{frame} 
\frametitle{CHAPTER 0: BIOST 310 REVIEW}
By the end of Chapter 0 you should be able to: \vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Identify and describe common study designs
\item Classify variables according to their type (e.g., binary)
\item Use numerical and graphical tools to summarize data
\item Explain features of and calculate probabilities using important probability distributions (Normal, t)
\item Define a sampling distribution
\item State the Central Limit Theorem and understand its importance for statistical inference
\item Construct and interpret confidence intervals
\item Formulate null and alternative hypotheses
\item Choose, implement, and interpret hypothesis tests
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Chapter 0 motivation
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why spend time reviewing these concepts?} % different courses, different instructors (and refresh for those for whom it's been awhile)
1. So everyone starts on the same page \\
2. These concepts are \textit{very} important for data analysis: \vspace{-0.35cm} % key components of data analysis
	\begin{itemize} \small \itemsep -0.5pt
	\item Understanding the data you have and its limititations: how (\textit{study design}) and what  (\textit{classifying variables}) was collected
	\item Converting your scientific questions into statistical ones (\textit{formulating hypotheses})
	\item Choosing appropriate statistical methods (based on $\uparrow$) 
	\item Summarizing your data (\textit{numerical and graphical summaries})
	\item \begin{footnotesize} (Most minor of all: running your chosen statistical methods) \end{footnotesize}
	\item Correctly interpreting your statistical results (\textit{parameter estimates, confidence intervals, p-values})
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Study design motivation
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Study Design}
\textit{How you collect data impacts what questions you can (cannot) answer, what statistical methods you can (cannot) use, and what conclusions you can (cannot) draw.}

\color{blue} Extreme Example: \color{black} Suppose I'm interested in understanding public opinion about biostatistics. I  randomly select one individual from our class and ask if he/she likes biostatistics. \vspace{-0.3cm}

\begin{itemize} % this example is a bit contrived, but demonstrates some of why we care so much about study design
\item What questions can I answer using these data? 
\item What statistical methods can I use to analyze these data? 
\item What conclusions can I draw using these data? 
\end{itemize} 

\end{frame}

% types of study designs
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Study Design: Experimental vs Observational}

\color{blue} Experimental: \color{black} exposure/treatment is \textit{controlled} by researcher (e.g., randomly assign people to drug or placebo) \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Randomized controlled trial % aka randomized control trial, randomized clinical trial
	\end{itemize}

\color{blue} Observational: \color{black} exposure/treatment is \textit{not controlled} by the researcher (e.g., we look at a group of people and \textit{observe} who smokes and who doesn't smoke)  \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Cross-sectional study
	\item Cohort study
	\item Case-control study
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Study Design: Experimental vs Observational}

In \textit{experimental} studies, we can talk about \color{blue} \textit{causation}\color{black}. In \textit{observational} studies we  talk instead about \color{blue} \textit{association} \color{black}(because we worry about \color{blue} \textit{confounding}\color{black}). % we'll come back to this when we talk about interpreting results

A \color{blue} \textit{confounder} \color{black} is a variable that is causally associated with our outcome and also associated with the exposure in our sample. \vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \textit{Example:} suppose we're interested in the relationship between smoking and lung function in kids. We know that age is causally associated with lung function: as children grow and develop, their lung function improves. If age is also associated with smoking in our sample (e.g., if older kids are more likely to smoke), then age is a confounder.
\end{itemize} 

\begin{small} \textit{Much more on this topic to come. Stay tuned!} \end{small}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame} % RCT
\frametitle{Experimental studies: randomized controlled trial}
Description:\vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Take a sample of the population, \textbf{randomly assign} to treatment (\textit{exposed}) or control/placebo (\textit{unexposed}), and follow for disease outcomes (death yes/no, time to death)
\end{itemize}

\pause
Pros:\vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item With a large enough sample, no confounding!
\item Gold standard for establishing causality
\end{itemize}

\pause
Cons:\vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Often very expensive
\item Not always possible or ethical to randomize
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Can't randomize sex, race, age, genetic variants
	\item Unethical to randomize to harmful exposures % e.g., smoking (FEV data), pollution (air pollution)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% cross-sectional studies
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Observational studies: cross-sectional study}
Description: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Randomly sample individuals, record their exposure and outcome at a \textit{single time point} (no follow-up) % take a snapshot, taking a cross-section of the population
\end{itemize}

\pause
Pros:\vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Relatively cheap and easy
\item Can study multiple outcomes and exposures % easy to collect a lot of data on each pers
\end{itemize}

\pause
Cons:\vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Inefficient for rare exposure or disease % you won't have very many (or any) people in your sample with the thing you're interested in
\item Time sequence of exposure and outcome (i.e., which came first) is not always clear % did low exercise lead to obesity, or obesity lead to low exercise?
\item Potential confounding (so no conclusions about causality)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Observational studies: cross-sectional study}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


% cohort studies
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Observational studies: cohort study}
Description: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sample \textit{people without the outcome} (sometimes based on exposure, sometimes random), record their exposure, then \textit{follow} those individuals and see who gets outcome % often called longitudinal cohort study, often outcome is death
\end{itemize}

\pause
Pros:\vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Time sequence is known (exposure came first)
\item Can study multiple outcomes 
\end{itemize}

\pause
Cons:\vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Inefficient for rare outcomes % have to wait a lont time to get enough people with disease
\item Often expensive and time-consuming to follow people, and oppportunities for people to drop out
\item Potential confounding (so no conclusions about causality)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% case-control studies
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Observational studies: case-control study}
Description: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Sample individuals based on the outcome} (some with, some without), look back in time (usually) for exposure % when you look back in time = retrospective case-control study
\end{itemize}

\pause
Pros:\vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Efficient for rare diseases % (don't have to recruit as many people)
\item Cheaper and faster than cohort studies
\item Can study multiple exposures
\end{itemize}

\pause
Cons:\vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
%\item Recall bias
\item May not know time sequence of disease and exposure
\item Cannot use to estimate relative risk or disease prevalence
\item Potential confounding (so no conclusions about causality)
\end{itemize}

Recent (June 2017) \href{http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1702747}{air pollution study} that has received a lot of attention in the news: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize} % headlines
\item ``U.S. air pollution still kills thousands every year, study concludes" -- NPR
\item ``Even 'safe' pollution levels can be deadly" --- NYT
\end{itemize}

% types of variables (brief reminders before we get to summarizing data)
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Summarizing Data (Step 1): Types of Variables} % why do we care

\textit{How you summarize/analyze your data often depends on what type of data you've collected.} 

So, the first step to summarizing/describing your data is making sure you know what kind of data you have!

\color{blue} Extreme Example: \color{black} Suppose I'm intereseted in summarizing one of the variables in our FEV dataset: smoking habits (smoker/nonsmoker).  What numerical summaries can I use to get a sense of ``typical" smoking habits in our study? \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize} % sketch what it looks like on board
\item Mean/average \pause \color{red} (No) \color{black}
\item Median \pause \color{red} (No) \color{black}
\item Mode \pause \color{red} (Yes) \color{black}
\item Proportion in each category \pause \color{red} (Yes) \color{black}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Summarizing Data (Step 1): Types of Variables}

\color{blue} Categorical: \color{black} limited number of possible values
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Nominal:} order doesn't matter (e.g., blood type)
\item \textit{Ordinal:} order does matter (e.g., level of education)
\item \textit{Binary:} two possible values; nominal or ordinal (e.g., sex)
\end{itemize}

\color{blue} Quantitative: \color{black} infinite possible values
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Discrete:} values are integers; often counts (e.g., \#  teeth)
\item \textit{Continuous:} values on continuum (e.g., height)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

	\item List 3 variables that the authors collected and record their type.
	\item How did the authors summarize their data? (e.g., What numerical summaries did they present? How were they displayed? What graphical summaries did they present?)
	\item Is there any information that you wish they would have provided in their summary but did not?

% summarizing data, why do we care? (human genome example)
\begin{frame} 
\frametitle{Summarizing Data: Motivation}
\textit{Why is it so important to know how to summarize data?} \\ One answer: because we can't look at all of it, but we still want to make sense of it and draw conclusions from it.

\color{blue} Extreme example: \color{black} The Human Genome
\vspace{-0.4cm} \begin{center} \includegraphics[height=4cm]{./dna} \end{center}

% why do we need descriptive stats
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Summarizing Data: Descriptive Statistics}
Why do we need descriptive statistics?\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Making sense of large amounts of data
\item Checking data quality
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Values outside reasonable range \begin{footnotesize} (e.g., height = 9') \end{footnotesize}
	\item Implausible combinations of variables \begin{footnotesize} (e.g., pregnant men) \end{footnotesize}
	\end{itemize}
\item Observe distribution of variables in dataset
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Measures of center and spread
	%\item Skewness
	\end{itemize}
\item Start to understand direction and strength of association
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Descriptive statistics and inferential analysis should contribute to the same story
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% types of descriptive statistics
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Descriptive Statistics: Outline}

\begin{itemize}
\item Univariate
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Numerical (categorical variables)
	\item Numerical (quantitative variables)
	\item Graphical
	\end{itemize}
\item Stratified/Bivariate
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Numerical summaries, broken down by subgroup
	\item Graphical
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

% numerical descrip for categorical variables
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Univariate Descriptive Statistics: Categorical}

Summary should include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number and percent in each group
	\begin{itemize}
	\item If outcome of interest is binary, make sure to mention number of events
	\end{itemize}
\item If binary, only need to summarize one group
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The other can be inferred
	\end{itemize}
\item Also good to summarize missing data
	\begin{itemize}
	\item e.g., \#  and proportion of missing values
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

How did the air pollution paper do? (Table 1, specifically.) % what's there (pct in each group, # events for outcome), what's missing (# and # missing)

\end{frame}

% numerical descrip for quantitative variables
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Univariate Descriptive Statistics: Quantitative}

Summary should include (some of):
\begin{itemize}
\item Sample size/number of observations
\item Number of missing observations
\item Measures of center: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Sample mean
	\item Sample median
	\end{itemize}
\item Measures of spread:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Sample standard deviation
	\item Interquartile range (IQR): (Q1,Q3) or (Q3 - Q1)
	\item Range: (Min,Max) or (Max - Min)
	\end{itemize}
%\item Note: you can detect skewness by comparing mean to median, IQR to median
%\item Note: you can detect outliers by looking at range
\end{itemize}
How did the air pollution paper do? (Table 1, specifically.) % what's there (average, # obs), what's missing (spread, # missing)

% histograms
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Univariate Descriptive Statistics: Graphical}

Histograms are useful for describing the shape of the distribution (for a quantitative variable):\vspace{-0.7cm}

\center \includegraphics[height=0.6\textheight]{./histogram-age}

\vspace{-0.45cm} \begin{scriptsize} R code:  \texttt{hist(fev\$age, xlab="Age (years)", ylab="Frequency", main="Histogram of Age")\\} \end{scriptsize}

\end{frame}

% boxplots
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Univariate Descriptive Statistics: Graphical}

Boxplots are useful for seeing outliers and central location (for a quantitative variable):\vspace{-0.8cm}

\center \includegraphics[height=0.7\textheight]{./boxplot-age}

% R code: 
\vspace{-1cm} \begin{scriptsize} \texttt{boxplot(fev\$age, xlab="", ylab="Age (years)", main="Boxplot of Age")} \end{scriptsize}

\end{frame}

% barplots
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Univariate Descriptive Statistics: Graphical}

Barplots can be used to summarize categorical variables: \\ \begin{footnotesize} (but here doesn't provide any more info than numerical summary) \end{footnotesize}\vspace{-0.8cm} % numerical summary = #/prop  in each category (smoke = 65 (9.9%), no smoke = 589 (90.1%))

\center \includegraphics[height=0.6\textheight]{./barplot-smoke}

% R code: 
\vspace{-0.5cm} \begin{scriptsize} \texttt{barplot(table(fev\$smoke), xlab="Smoking (1 = yes, 2 = no)", ylab="Count", main="Bar Plot of Smoking")\\} \end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}

% stratified descriptive statistics
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Stratified Descriptive Statistics} % useful for categorical vs quantitative comparisons

Sometimes we're interested in the distribution of a variable within certain subgroups: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item e.g., how does the distribution of age differ between smokers and non-smokers in our FEV dataset? % from Monday, how does distribution of FEV differ between teens and pre-teens
\end{itemize}

Stratified descriptive statistics can help us:\vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item understand the role of that  stratification variable (e.g., is it a confounder?)
\item begin to demonstrate the association between two variables (one quantitative, one categrical)
\end{itemize}

\begin{footnotesize} \textit{It's often helpful to present stratified descriptive statistics in your ``Table 1" (stratified by outcome or exposure, depending on application). Did the air pollution paper do this?} \end{footnotesize}

% examples in air pollution Table 1

\texttt{\#plot on right: \\ hist(subset(fev,smoke==2)\$age, xlab="Age (years)", ylab="Frequency", main="Histogram of Age (Non-Smokers)")\\} \end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}

% stratified boxplots
\begin{frame}

\end{frame}

% scatterplot
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Bivariate Descriptive Statistics}

Scatterplots are a useful tool for summarizing the relationship between two quantitative variables:

\vspace{-0.8cm} \center \includegraphics[height=0.65\textheight]{./scatterplot-fev-age}

\vspace{-0.4cm} \begin{scriptsize} \texttt{plot(fev\$fev $\sim$ fev\$age, xlab='Age (years)', ylab='FEV (liters per sec)', main = 'Scatterplot of FEV vs Age')\\} \end{scriptsize}
